This repository holds the Go code review tools.

The codereview.py script itself remains in the main Go repository,
at least for now, but to use the script's clpatch command, you need
to install hgpatch, by doing

	go get code.google.com/p/go.codereview/cmd/hgpatch

To submit changes to this repository, see http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html.
